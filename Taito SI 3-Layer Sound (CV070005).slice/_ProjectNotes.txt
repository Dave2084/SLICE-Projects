When testing the shifter circuit (ICs 9-12, 14-16 and 41-44) ensure that you have a game in progress or the ICs will not be active.  Note that CV ROMs do not use the shifter.

Caution: This board has a 12v supply for the sound section. Ensure that the test clip and ground do not come into contact with voltages over 5v or damage to the Digilent unit may occur.
