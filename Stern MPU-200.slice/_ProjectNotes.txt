Caution: This board has +12v and +43v supplies, SLICE at your own risk!

The +12v is used for the diagnostic LED and the valid power detector circuit which outputs to /RESET which possibly only connects to the 6800, 6821s and J5.

The +43v is used in the Zero crossing detector and feeds into U14.  Do not attempt to use slice with this connected.

Ensure that the test clip and ground do not come into contact with voltages over 5v or damage to the Digilent unit may occur.

For safe SLICEing do the following:
• Remove ALL Connectors.
• Connect TP4 (Ground) to PSU Ground.
• Connect TP5 (+5v) to PSU +5v.
• Connect TP2 (+12v) to PSU +5v - This will allow the LED (CR8) to illuminate for diagnostic flashes.
• Connect J5 Pin 25 (/RESET) to J5 Pin 30 (+5v) - This will allow the CPU to run.

Notes:
• You may have to disconnect and reconnect J5 Pin 25 to get the PCB to boot.
• The diagnostic LED will be very dim in this configuration.
• The board will boot with this voltage missing but will not pass the last diagnostic (LED flash) test.
• You can force the last LED flash to pass by temporarily connecting the top of R17 and the top of R23.
