For the 74LS04 at IC07 that inverts the clock signals use the [SPACE] option to toggle the device to 'DIP+' and get a results grab to show frequencies for all pins. The stored result was sampled this way.

For the 2114 RAM it is grouped into two banks that are only active when the screen is normal or flipped (Player 2 in a cocktail game). The normal bank is enabled by signal ONE-00 (ICs 25, 27, 41 & 43). The flipped bank is enabled by signal ONE-01 (ICs 26, 28, 42 & 44).
