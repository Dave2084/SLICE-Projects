Note that this boardset has significant differences from a standard Galaxian/Moon Cresta board and comes in two standard sized taito boards joined by two 50-pin ribbons and a smaller sound board that attaches to the top board.

As well as there layout being different there are differences in the circuits.

There are no known schematics available.
